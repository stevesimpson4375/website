		<h1>Some basic geography</h1>
	  
		<p>Pennsylvania is a little mountainous on the southern parts. It really starts around Pittsburgh. The area east of the city is pretty rocky, but there are not many cliffs and things. North and west of the city looks more like the mid-west. Going directly south of the city leads through rolling hills that eventually fade into the Appalacian mountains.</p>

		<h1>Pennsylvania and craft beer</h1>
		
		<p>One unique thing about Pennsylvania ins that there is a ton of craft beer. I have not done that much travelling recently, so maybe craft beer has gotten popular everywhere and I just didn't notice, but Pennsylvania has more than I can count. I actually live in a town about 40 minutes north of Pittsburgh, which is considered a short drive here, and our little town has its own brewpub <a href='http://www.beaverbrewingcompany.com/'>Beaver Brewing Co</a>. No one around seemed to think it was unique to have a place that around.</p>

		<h1>Pretty good for cycling, if you don't mid a close call or two</h1>
		
		<p>Due to the wide variety of terrain, Pennsylvania is a good place to bike. There are some very steep hills, miles of flat, and everything in between. There are also enough cyclists out there that cars are used to seeing them around and there are some considerations for bike traffic. There are also enough people who have a mysterious hatred of anyone who is not wrapped in a metal covering to make it a little dicey at times.</p>
