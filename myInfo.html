				<h3>My Hobbies are:</h3>	  	
					<ol>
						<li>Cycling <br />
						I didn't start cycling until a few years ago. I had a co-worker that was a competitive cyclist and used to ride his carbon fiber bike to work. This was in 2009 and I had just given up smoking and thought cycling would help me get healthier.</li>
						<li>Gaming<br />
						I have been gaming since I was a small child. I do not quite recall what year it was, but I had an SNES when they were very new. Prior to that I had a Tandy from RadioShack. I spent many hours playing games like Arkanoid. Sadly I missed out on PC gaming in the 90s. I only played console games and did not get to enjoy more complex PC games. Today I am about 95% PC gaming only and I am contemplating buying a Radeon 290X in preparation for GTA V.</li>
						<li>Cars<br />
						I inherited the hobby of driving and working on cars from my father. I used to hear about people who buy a project car and let it sit for years and think "Why on earth would you do that?". Today, I know why. I bought a 1974 Corvette in 2011 and have barely touched it. Working on the other cars I need to use to get places and things like work and school have caused a significant delay in fixing up that car. My current project is finishing repairs to a 1995 Eagle Talon that I have had since high school. It has had a rough life including a brief moment upside down. I always liked that car and it gets fantastic fuel mileage. I am planning to make it my next driver.</li>

				<h4>Honorable mentions:</h4>
				<p>
					I have been trying to work on a number of other hobbies, however I do not include them when asked because I did not really succeed.
					For instance, I have played guitar of and on for years now. I can play a number of things, however I never learned to read music and forgot more than I know.
					<br /><br />
					I have also purchased a motorcycle and attempted to ride it. Actually learning to ride is still on my to-do list. My initial attempt was ended due to
					an issue with the clutch. I bought a used motorcycle from a dealer that was slightly cheaper than the same motorcycle everywhere else. I would have tried to
					argue that the dealer obviously knew of the issue since riding motorcycles that are for sale is necessary, if only to move them around. However I bought
					it in January and didn't try to ride it until April. I do not think it will be expensive or difficult to fix, however I had an incident where I injured my knee
					and I came to the realization that hitting the asphalt would REALLY hurt.
